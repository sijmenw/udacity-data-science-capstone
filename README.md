# Udacity Data Science Capstone Project

This repo contains code to train a LSTM model on stock data.

Automatically generates a small HTML report that shows an overview of trained models.

A GUI is available to select:

- stocks (tickers) to train on
- date range for training data
- number of epochs.

# How to use

## Train a model

Start the GUI by running:

`python train_gui.py`

The window below will open, select the stocks and dates you want to train on and press *Train!*. By default Google and Apple stocks are selected.

## Compare models

Open `models_report.html` to see the overview of previously trained models, an example can be found at `example_report.html`.
